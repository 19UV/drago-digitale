## A Short Story
Once upon a time, I decided that I wanted a domain (as we all do). So, I went
and bought drago-digitale.com with no plan for it (as we all do). Now out of
both the very real realization that my domain is slowly draining money out of
my bank account, and because I don't want to do my German homework, I created this!

## My Plans
This will likely be a spot to showcase my projects (4D rendering & other random
stuff), and to learn how to setup a Nuxt website hosted from Github Pages (sorry
Microsoft). But, who knows? Maybe I'll include something more.
